# ml_from_scratch

## What the project does?
-> The purpose of this project is for me (O-rensa) to be familiar with the syntax of zig and learn a little bit about Machine Learning.
-> The project uses zig for ML objects implementation and a web app(HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT) for GUI.
-> This project uses API's for interaction between zig and web app.

## Why not use Zig's GUI libraries?
-> I got a day job and I learning some libraries most of the times makes me sleepy.

## Why not use Web Assembly?
-> I wanna do this a simple as possible based on my current skills.
-> I don't know how to use Web Assembly.

## Why the project is useful?
-> It's not.

## How users can get started with the project?
-> Why would you use this shit?

## Where users can get help with your project?
-> Not my problem.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project?
-> Only me.
-> I got no plans of maintaining this after it's finished. So DON'T BOTHER!!!
-> I doubt I would even finish this.
