# ml_from_scratch

## What the project does?
-> The purpose of this project is for me (O-rensa) to be familiar with the syntax of zig and learn a little bit about Machine Learning. <br/>
-> The project uses zig for ML objects implementation and a web app(HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT) for GUI. <br/>
-> This project uses API's for interaction between zig and web app. <br />
-> This project is based on [this youtube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa3BE_VwyS4&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYe9aJXfWw-Dw_4VnFrqRC4). <br/>
